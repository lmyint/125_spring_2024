One of the metrics used to evaluate progress towards this goal is Age-standardized mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution.\n\nThe CDC‚Äôs data briefs contain a section about age-adjusted death rates for race-ethnicity-sex groups.\n\n\n\nSynthesis activity\nThe following prompt is meant to resemble one that could be used for our first Content Conversation. It is meant to encourage thinking about how our ideas are used in practice and to reinforce conceptual understanding underlying the practice problems we do in our activities.\nPrompt: A community health organization wants to determine whether to devote more resources to addressing mental health issues or cardiovascular health issues. You‚Äôll help them approach this decision through the lens of our course topics so far.\n\nWould prevalence data be useful in this decision making? What about incidence data? How would this data be used in the decision making process?\nHow would you go about collecting prevalence and/or incidence data within the communities served by the community health organization? If you collect incidence data, will you likely summarize that data with cumulative incidence or incidence rate? What problems do you foresee in collecting accurate data?\nSuppose that the community health organization wants to implement changes to their mental health resources and look at the incidence of mental health issues after this change. They want to compare this to mental health incidence data from the previous year to evaluate the efficacy of their new resources. How might ideas related to direct standardization be relevant here?\n\n\nDirections: Take 10 minutes to outline some ideas for addressing this prompt on your own. Afterwards, share ideas with your group.\n\nA good response should:\n\nShow understanding of the difference between prevalence and incidence\nPresent feasible means of collecting prevalence/incidence data and acknowledge the limitations of that data collection process\nShow understanding of the difference between cumulative incidence and incidence rate\nShow understanding of how direct standardization relates to the goal of making fair comparisons\n\n\nIdeas from the instructor:\n\nWho is suffering more now? Who will be suffering more in the future? The distinction between these two questions leads us to consider prevalence data (former question) and incidence data (latter question).\nIn this context, survey data seems like the most feasible option. Wording survey questions so that they measure what we want will require careful attention. Prevalence data could be measured with a single survey. If wanting to collect current incidence data we will need repeated surveys, which are prone to dropout. It is also possible to collect incidence data retrospectively by asking participants when they developed a condition. However, this type of question is subject to recall bias‚Äìthe tendency to inaccurately recall information from the past.\nFor collecting current incidence data where we follow community members forward in time, we will want to keep in mind how many people are followed for the full time. If many people move, for example, and are not followed for the full time span in which we are collecting incidence data, we would likely prefer to summarize incidence using the incidence rate rather than cumulative incidence because incidence rate takes into account information from people who are not observed for the full time span.\nThe comparison of mental health incidence rates before and after introduction of new resources is a comparison whose goal is to estimate the true (causal) impact of those new resources. The comparison of incidence rates might be unfair if something other than the use of resources is different between the populations in which those incidences are measured. For example, if the time spans being compared are pre-COVID and during COVID, there are certainly differences in exercise levels that could affect incidence of mental health issues. It could be useful to apply the ideas of direct standardization to ensure that the pre- and during-COVID times have the same distribution of exercise levels. This would help us make a more fair comparison."

    "text": "My philosophy\nGrading is thorny issue for many educators because of its known negative effects on learning and motivation. Nonetheless, it is ever-present in the US education system and at Macalester. Because I am required to submit grades for this course, it‚Äôs worth me taking a minute to share my philosophy about grading with you.\nWhat excites me about being a teacher is your learning. Learning flourishes in an environment where you find meaning and value in what we‚Äôre exploring, feel safe engaging with challenging things, receive useful feedback, and regularly reflect on your learning.\nIf I didn‚Äôt have to give grades, I wouldn‚Äôt. But because I am required to, it is important to me to create a course structure and grading system that creates an environment for learning to flourish:\n\nFinding meaning and value: I am striving to achieve this by creating space for authentic connection between you, your peers, and myself and by encouraging you to explore a topic that intrigues you for our course project.\nSafety in engaging with challenges: The assignments and activities that we will use to learn are meant to be challenging, and it would be unreasonable for me to expect that you perform perfectly on the first try. For this reason, every assignment and assessment has an opportunity for unlimited revisions/reattempts without penalty. I hope that this alleviates stress considerably. If ever you are feeling overwhelmed by this course, please reach out to me. We‚Äôll find a way to make things more manageable.\n\nNote: While the number of revisions you can submit is unlimited in theory, in practice, there is a limit to how quickly the preceptors and I can review revisions and give feedback.\n\nReceiving useful feedback and reflecting regularly: In order to learn maximally by pursuing a revision, you need BOTH good feedback and to reflect thoughtfully about misconceptions in your learning. Our preceptors and I will strive to give useful comments and prompts to spur reflection when we see room for improvement. A requirement for submitting a revision is to include a paragraph where you describe and reflect on your prior misconceptions."

Otherwise the grade will be Not Yet (NY).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\nThe purpose of homework is to re-engage with core ideas from class in the context of new examples.\n\n\nRevising and resubmitting HW: If you receive a grade of NY, you can revise and resubmit your work without penalty as long as you do the following:\n\nWrite a reflection paragraph at the top of your assignment in which you address: What improvements were you asked to make based on feedback on your previous submission? How has reviewing your feedback improved your understanding? (What do you understand better/differently than you did before?)\nKeep all of your original work intact and include revisions in different color text (e.g., blue or orange)\nSubmit your revised work to the same homework link on Moodle.

If you miss class this day, you will need to complete the mini-project on your own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the mini-projects is to synthesize ideas across the topics in a unit and enhance your understanding through collaboration. The projects will be designed to be finished within class time.\n\n\nProjects will a grade of Pass (P) or Not Yet (NY). Requirements for passing each mini-project will be clearly stated on each project prompt.\nRevising and resubmitting mini-projects: If you receive a grade of NY, you can revise and resubmit your work without penalty as long as you do the following:\n\nEach group member must submit a reflection paragraph that addresses: What improvements were you asked to make based on feedback on your previous submission? How has reviewing your feedback improved your understanding? (What do you understand better/differently than you did before?) Each group member should email this reflection paragraph to the instructor.\nOne group member should submit the revised project file to the same link on Moodle. This group member should email the instructor once this is submitted.\n\n\n\nContent conversations\nA content conversation (CC) is a 15 or 20 minute conversation that you and I will have about course content. There will be 2 CC‚Äôs in the semester (weeks of 2/19 and 4/22).\n\nContent conversation 1: This conversation will be 15 minutes. Schedule this during the week of 2/21-2/28 via Calendly.\nContent conversation 2: This conversation will be 20 minutes. Schedule this during the week of 4/22-4/26 via Calendly.\n\nOne week before the CC, I will provide a set of problems that you can (and should!) work on with peers. During the CC, we will talk through a subset of those problems. I will choose some problems that I‚Äôd like you to talk through, and in the time remaining, you will talk through a problem (or part of a problem) of your choosing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\nThe purpose of a CC is to encourage deep and collaborative study and to give us both a detailed understanding of your learning.\n\n\nBefore the CC I will provide a rubric that explains how I will assess your understanding. I will also provide requirements for a grade of Pass. If you do not Pass a CC, you will receive a grade of Not Yet.\nRe-attempting a content conversation: If you receive a grade of NY, you can re-attempt the CC without penalty as long as you do the following:\n\nSchedule another conversation of the same length as the original CC (via Calendly).\nRevise how you will talk through the problem (or parts of problems) that you struggled with.\nReflect on the following: What improvements were you asked to make based on feedback on your previous submission? How has reviewing your feedback improved your understanding? (What do you understand better/differently than you did before?) Be prepared to tell me about this reflection at the next CC.\n\n\n\nProject\nWe will have a course-long project in which you apply concepts from class to evaluate research related to a health-adjacent topic of your choosing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the project is to connect course concepts with a topic that is relevant and meaningful to you.\n\n\nOn each homework assignment, there will be a task that advances your project in a way that connects to the most recent course concepts. You will receive feedback that you should incorporate into your final product.\nMore details about the project will be hosted on the Project page."
