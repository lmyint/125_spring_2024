# Learning goals

After this lesson, you should be able to:

- Explain why one might one prefer to conduct a case-control study over a cohort study
- Explain why odds ratios rather than relative risks are used as a measure of association in case-control studies
- Compute an interpret an odds ratio from study data

# Recap of video material

## Cohort vs. case-control studies

Nature of sampling

- Cohort: Sample by exposure status
- Case-control: Sample by disease status

Resources needed

- Cohort:
    - If using a prospective cohort study, a lot of time might be needed for the disease to develop
    - Might need to enroll a large number of patients if the disease is rare
- Case-control:
    - All data on outcomes and exposures are available without having to wait for follow up (like a retrospective cohort study)

Other considerations

## Odds

> Odds are, when someone talks about odds, they're not talking about odds.

If $p$ is the probability of an event (say, the risk of disease in an exposed group), the **odds** of that event is:

$$\mathrm{odds} = \frac{p}{1-p}$$

In other words, the odds tells us **how much more likely an event is to happen than not happen**.

- Unlike probability, it is not between 0 and 1. Odds can go from 0 to infinity.
- Increasing odds *does* mean increasing probability.
    - If Event A has higher odds than Event B, Event A is indeed more likely than Event B.

## Odds ratios as measures of association

Jump to [Moodle](https://moodle.macalester.edu/mod/folder/view.php?id=87525), and open the PDF titled `OR_RR_handout`. We'll walk through this handout together.

## Potential biases in selection of cases and controls

We'll explore some scenarios on Thursday.
